HarryR93/HarryVanguard

Self-taught, introverted, weebish and somewhat lazy developer going into IT major, currently studying at an economics university... a weird combination isn't it?

Moderate knowledge of Lua/C++, planning to learn JS/HTML/CSS. Not much is gonna be shown here, but feel free to follow my projects.

You don't have to be a master at everything, but you should definitely know a bit of everything.
